              UWNSAâ€™s goal is to celebrate Nepalese culture, empower our
              community and foster meaningful connections. Through cultural
              events, educational initiatives and collaborations across Nepalese
              Student Associations across Universities in Ontario, we aim to
              create a space where members can explore their heritage, learn
              from shared experiences, and connect with a supportive network in
              the UW community. <br /> <br />
